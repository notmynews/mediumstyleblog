In a bizarre turn of events, Jaywick's controversial Workers Party has sparked outrage by proposing a ban on Hanukkah celebrations at the local pub, "Never Say Die." The move, described by critics as "blatantly discriminatory," has led to heated debates in the small seaside community, which is no stranger to controversy.  

### "Preserve Local Traditions"

The Workers Party, a self-proclaimed advocate for "working-class values," claims the ban is intended to preserve the pub’s "local traditions." A spokesperson for the group said, “The Never Say Die is a place for darts, karaoke, and pints—not candle lighting and dreidels. This is about keeping the pub’s character intact.”  

Unsurprisingly, this rationale hasn’t gone down well with the locals, with many branding the move as "thinly veiled bigotry."  

### Outrage and Backlash  

Regular patrons of the Never Say Die, known for its eclectic clientele and £1 tequila shots, were quick to voice their opinions. “They don’t even come to the pub! How can they decide what happens here?” said one furious customer, pint in hand. Another patron, who asked not to be named, added, “They’re always banging on about freedom, but now they want to tell us what we can celebrate? It’s madness.”  

Jaywick’s small Jewish community, while not regular visitors to the Never Say Die, has also expressed dismay at the proposal. “Hanukkah is a celebration of perseverance and light—it’s for everyone. If anything, this town could use a bit more of both,” said one local resident.  

### The Landlord Speaks  

The pub’s landlord, Dave “Big D” Milligan, has rejected the Workers Party's demands outright. “This pub is for everyone, and I mean *everyone*. If people want to come in, have a drink, and spin a dreidel, who am I to stop them?” Milligan told the Gazette.  

He added, “We’ve hosted everything from stag dos to psychic nights. Honestly, a bit of Hanukkah might class the place up.”  

### Dividing Jaywick  

The controversy has drawn attention beyond Jaywick’s borders, with social media users from across Essex weighing in. One user wrote, “Only in Jaywick could you have a political party trying to ban a festival at a pub named *Never Say Die.* You couldn’t make it up.”  

Meanwhile, the Workers Party appears to be doubling down on its stance, promising to hold a public meeting to "discuss cultural preservation." However, with public sentiment overwhelmingly against them, it’s unclear whether their position will hold.  

### A Bigger Conversation  

The debate has ignited a wider conversation about inclusion in Jaywick, a town often plagued by stereotypes and divisions. As one local summed up, “This isn’t about Hanukkah. It’s about whether Jaywick is the kind of place that welcomes people, or the kind that pushes them out. I know which one I’d rather live in.”  

For now, the Never Say Die will continue to welcome all who pass through its doors—whether they’re lighting candles or just ordering another round.
