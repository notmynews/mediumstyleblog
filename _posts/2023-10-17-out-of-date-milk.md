In a shocking development, a woman in Jaywick, Essex, has bought milk from Morrisons Daily that was due to go off the next day. The woman, who has not been named, is said to be "furious" with the supermarket chain, and is demanding a refund.

"I can't believe it," said the woman. "I bought the milk yesterday, and it's already gone off. It's absolutely disgusting. I'm going to have to throw it away now."

Morrisons Daily has defended the sale of the milk, saying that it is "perfectly safe to drink" for up to 24 hours after the expiration date. However, the woman is not convinced.

"I don't care what they say," she said. "This milk is off, and I'm not drinking it. I'm going back to Morrisons tomorrow and demanding a refund."

The incident has sparked a debate about the quality of food sold in supermarkets. Some people have defended Morrisons, saying that it is unfair to expect them to sell milk that is guaranteed to last for several days. Others have criticized the supermarket, saying that it is putting customers at risk by selling milk that is close to expiring.

It is not yet clear whether the woman will be successful in getting a refund from Morrisons. However, one thing is for sure: she is not likely to be buying milk from there again anytime soon.
