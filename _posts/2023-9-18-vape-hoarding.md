A man in Clacton, Essex, is reportedly stockpiling disposable vapes in fear of a ban on their sale. The man, who has not been named, has been seen buying dozens of disposable vapes at a local convenience store.

"I'm not taking any chances," the man said. "I heard they're going to ban these things, so I'm stocking up while I can."

The man's actions have been met with mixed reactions. Some people have praised him for being prepared, while others have criticized him for contributing to the problem of disposable vape waste.

"It's ridiculous," said one woman. "He's just going to end up throwing them all away when the ban comes into effect."

"I think it's smart," said another man. "He's just looking out for himself."

The ban on disposable vapes is due to come into effect in the next few months. The government has said that the ban is necessary to reduce the amount of waste from disposable vapes, which are often littered.

The man in Clacton is not the only one who is stockpiling disposable vapes. There have been reports of people across the country doing the same thing.

It remains to be seen how many people will actually be affected by the ban. Some people may switch to reusable vapes, while others may simply give up vaping altogether.

Only time will tell what the long-term impact of the ban will be. But for now, the man in Clacton is just one of many people who are preparing for a future without disposable vapes.
