A man has been left seriously injured after being stabbed during a Facebook Marketplace sale involving a PlayStation 2 and a copy of FIFA Street, in an incident that has left locals questioning how a nostalgia-fuelled console exchange escalated so dramatically.

The stabbing took place following an arranged meet-up between buyer and seller, believed to have been organised through Facebook Marketplace. What was meant to be a straightforward cash-for-console transaction reportedly descended into a heated argument shortly after the parties met in person.

According to witnesses, the dispute centred around the condition and authenticity of the game FIFA Street, a cult-classic PS2 title that has recently surged in popularity among retro gaming enthusiasts. One onlooker claimed voices were raised after the buyer allegedly accused the seller of “overhyping the disc condition.”

Moments later, the confrontation turned violent.

Emergency services were called to the scene, where the victim was treated for stab wounds before being taken to hospital. His injuries are described as serious but not life-threatening. Essex Police have confirmed that an investigation is underway and that enquiries are ongoing to locate the suspect.

A spokesperson for the police said:
“This was a serious incident that appears to have arisen from a pre-arranged online sale. We urge anyone meeting strangers for transactions to do so in public, well-lit areas and to prioritise personal safety.”

The incident has sparked widespread disbelief online, with many questioning how a second-hand PlayStation 2 and a street football video game could lead to such violence.

One local resident commented, “It’s madness. It’s not even FIFA 06. It’s FIFA Street.”

Facebook Marketplace has come under renewed scrutiny in recent months amid a rise in reports of disputes, scams, and violent incidents linked to private sales arranged through the platform.

As for the PlayStation 2 and FIFA Street, their whereabouts remain unclear. Police have not confirmed whether the console was recovered.

The incident serves as a stark reminder that even the most nostalgic of purchases can take a dark turn—and that no retro console is worth risking your life for.
