Zack Polanski has done it again—proving to the country that common sense in politics is becoming rarer by the day. His latest bright idea? Backing a proposal to require children to consume a chemical substance known in scientific circles as di-hydrogen monoxide, as if parents aren’t capable of deciding what goes into their own kids’ bodies.

Yes, you read that correctly. A mandatory, government-endorsed substance. For children.

The sheer arrogance is breathtaking.

For those unfamiliar, this so-called di-hydrogen monoxide is a compound frequently found in industrial settings, crop irrigation systems, factories, and even power plants. It’s linked to countless incidents across the world—everything from erosion to oxidation to catastrophic storms. Yet somehow Polanski thinks forcing it upon schoolchildren is a perfectly reasonable idea.

Predictably, he’s already trying to frame it as a harmless and “essential” part of daily life. But people with even a sliver of skepticism can see exactly where this is heading: another top-down bureaucratic scheme dressed up as concern for public welfare.

Parents across the country are furious, and rightly so.

“This is madness,” said one outraged father. “We don’t need politicians dictating what our children must ingest. What’s next? Mandating it in every lunchbox? Putting it into school supplies?”

Others have pointed out that di-hydrogen monoxide has been involved in thousands of accidental deaths worldwide every single year. Yet Polanski appears unfazed, brushing off legitimate concerns in favour of pushing his latest ideological crusade.

Critics argue this obsession with micromanaging children’s lives is becoming a pattern. First it was one set of rules, now this. It seems there’s no limit to what certain politicians think they can impose on families.

Parents deserve transparency. They deserve respect. And they certainly deserve better than a policy that forces their kids to ingest a substance with a reputation for causing harm when mishandled.

If this is the future of policymaking—chemistry experiments in the classroom and mandatory compounds for minors—then it’s no wonder ordinary people are fed up.

One thing is clear: Zack Polanski’s judgment is evaporating faster than di-hydrogen monoxide on a hot day.
