The Wilko store on St John's Walk in Colchester is to close after a rescue deal fell through. The store was one of 300 Wilko stores nationwide that were put into administration in June 2023. A rescue deal was proposed by HMV owner Doug Putman, but this has now collapsed.

The closure of the Wilko store in Colchester will be a blow to the city centre. The store is a popular destination for shoppers, and it will also mean the loss of 40 jobs.

There is some hope that the store could be used as a food bank. The Trussell Trust, which runs a network of food banks, has said that it is in talks with the administrators of Wilko about the possibility of using the store as a food bank.

A spokesperson for the Trussell Trust said: "We are in discussions with the administrators of Wilko about the possibility of using the store as a food bank. This would be a great opportunity to provide much-needed support to people in Colchester who are struggling to afford food."

The closure of the Wilko store is a reminder of the challenges facing the retail sector. The rise of online shopping and the cost of living crisis have put a strain on many retailers.

It is hoped that the store can be repurposed as a food bank or another community-focused use. This would help to ensure that the building continues to serve the people of Colchester.

In addition to the Trussell Trust, other organizations that have expressed an interest in using the Wilko store include the Salvation Army and Colchester Foodbank. The Salvation Army has said that it could use the store to provide a range of services, including food, clothing, and furniture. Colchester Foodbank has said that it could use the store to provide emergency food parcels to people in need.

The future of the Wilko store is still uncertain, but it is hoped that it can be used to provide a valuable service to the community.
