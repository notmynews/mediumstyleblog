Serious concerns have been raised in Jaywick after it emerged that a private, US-backed company with alleged links to far-right Christian groups in the United States has been offering local residents £100 in exchange for undergoing sterilisation.

The scheme, which has quietly been operating out of the Jaywick Community and Resource Centre, is reportedly holding sessions every Wednesday and Sunday afternoon, targeting some of the area’s most vulnerable residents. Locals have described the programme as “deeply unsettling” and “ethically rotten”.

According to information seen by the Gazette, representatives of the organisation present the offer as a “voluntary lifestyle choice incentive”, though critics argue the financial inducement amounts to coercion in an area already struggling with poverty and long-term deprivation.

“It doesn’t feel voluntary when people are desperate,” said one Jaywick resident. “Offering cash for something so permanent in a place like this is morally bankrupt.”

**Links to US Extremist Groups**

Investigations into the organisation’s background suggest troubling connections to far-right Christian movements in the US, some of which are known for promoting extremist views on reproduction, “genetic purity”, and social engineering. While the company operates under a neutral-sounding name, critics claim its ideology becomes clear once you dig beneath the surface.

Campaigners allege the group has previously attempted similar schemes in economically deprived areas overseas, often under the guise of “community improvement” or “personal responsibility initiatives”.

“This is eugenics dressed up as charity,” said a local activist. “It’s the same old dangerous ideas, just repackaged with a £100 note.”

**Community Anger Grows**

The revelation has sparked outrage among Jaywick residents, with many questioning how such an organisation was allowed access to a public community facility in the first place.

Parents and campaigners have demanded immediate answers from those managing the Community and Resource Centre, calling for the sessions to be halted and for a full review into how external groups are vetted.

“Jaywick is not a testing ground for ideological experiments dreamed up in America,” said one furious resident. “We’re not lab rats.”

**Calls for Intervention**

Local groups are now calling on authorities to step in, investigate the organisation’s activities, and ensure residents are protected from what many see as predatory behaviour.

As pressure mounts, the company involved has yet to issue a public statement addressing the accusations or clarifying the nature of its funding and ideological links.

For now, many in Jaywick are left asking the same question: how did a cash-for-sterilisation scheme linked to extremist beliefs end up operating openly in the heart of their community?
